API reference
=============

.. currentmodule:: websockets

websockets provides client and server implementations, as shown in
the :doc:`getting started guide <../intro/index>`.

The process for opening and closing a WebSocket connection depends on which
side you're implementing.

* On the client side, connecting to a server with :func:`~client.connect`
  yields a connection object that provides methods for interacting with the
  connection. Your code can open a connection, then send or receive messages.

  If you use :func:`~client.connect` as an asynchronous context manager,
  then websockets closes the connection on exit. If not, then your code is
  responsible for closing the connection.

* On the server side, :func:`~server.serve` starts listening for client
  connections and yields an server object that you can use to shut down
  the server.

  Then, when a client connects, the server initializes a connection object and
  passes it to a handler coroutine, which is where your code can send or
  receive messages. This pattern is called `inversion of control`_. It's
  common in frameworks implementing servers.

  When the handler coroutine terminates, websockets closes the connection. You
  may also close it in the handler coroutine if you'd like.

Once the connection is open, the WebSocket protocol is symmetrical, except for
low-level details that websockets manages under the hood. The same methods
are available on client connections created with :func:`~client.connect` and
on server connections received in argument by the connection handler
of :func:`~server.serve`.

Since websockets provides the same API — and uses the same code — for client
and server connections, common methods are documented in a "Both sides" page.

Public API documented in the API reference are subject to the
:ref:`backwards-compatibility policy <backwards-compatibility policy>`.

Anything that isn't listed in the API reference is a private API. There's no
guarantees of behavior or backwards-compatibility for private APIs.

For convenience, many public APIs can be imported from the ``websockets``
package. This feature is incompatible with static code analysis tools such as
mypy_, though. If you're using such tools, use the full import path.
