WebSockets
==========

``websockets`` is a library for developing WebSocket servers_ and clients_ in
Python. It implements `RFC 6455`_ with a focus on correctness and simplicity.
It passes the `Autobahn Testsuite`_.

Built on top of Python's asynchronous I/O support introduced in `PEP 3156`_,
it provides an API based on coroutines, making it easy to write highly
concurrent applications.

Installation is as simple as ``pip install websockets``. It requires Python ≥
3.4 or Python 3.3 with the ``asyncio`` module, which is available with ``pip
install asyncio``.

Documentation is available on `Read the Docs`_.

Bug reports, patches and suggestions welcome! Just open an issue_ or send a
`pull request`_.
