class WebSocketCommonProtocol(asyncio.Protocol):
    """
    WebSocket connection.

    :class:`WebSocketCommonProtocol` provides APIs shared between WebSocket
    servers and clients. You shouldn't use it directly. Instead, use
    :class:`~websockets.legacy.client.WebSocketClientProtocol` or
    :class:`~websockets.legacy.server.WebSocketServerProtocol`.

    This documentation focuses on low-level details that aren't covered in the
    documentation of :class:`~websockets.legacy.client.WebSocketClientProtocol`
    and :class:`~websockets.legacy.server.WebSocketServerProtocol` for the sake
    of simplicity.

    Once the connection is open, a Ping_ frame is sent every ``ping_interval``
    seconds. This serves as a keepalive. It helps keeping the connection open,
    especially in the presence of proxies with short timeouts on inactive
    connections. Set ``ping_interval`` to :obj:`None` to disable this behavior.

    .. _Ping: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.2

    If the corresponding Pong_ frame isn't received within ``ping_timeout``
    seconds, the connection is considered unusable and is closed with code 1011.
    This ensures that the remote endpoint remains responsive. Set
    ``ping_timeout`` to :obj:`None` to disable this behavior.

    .. _Pong: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.3

    See the discussion of :doc:`keepalive <../../topics/keepalive>` for details.

    The ``close_timeout`` parameter defines a maximum wait time for completing
    the closing handshake and terminating the TCP connection. For legacy
    reasons, :meth:`close` completes in at most ``5 * close_timeout`` seconds
    for clients and ``4 * close_timeout`` for servers.

    ``close_timeout`` is a parameter of the protocol because websockets usually
    calls :meth:`close` implicitly upon exit:

    * on the client side, when using :func:`~websockets.legacy.client.connect`
      as a context manager;
    * on the server side, when the connection handler terminates.

    To apply a timeout to any other API, wrap it in :func:`~asyncio.timeout` or
    :func:`~asyncio.wait_for`.

    The ``max_size`` parameter enforces the maximum size for incoming messages
    in bytes. The default value is 1 MiB. If a larger message is received,
    :meth:`recv` will raise :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError`
    and the connection will be closed with code 1009.

    The ``max_queue`` parameter sets the maximum length of the queue that
    holds incoming messages. The default value is ``32``. Messages are added
    to an in-memory queue when they're received; then :meth:`recv` pops from
    that queue. In order to prevent excessive memory consumption when
    messages are received faster than they can be processed, the queue must
    be bounded. If the queue fills up, the protocol stops processing incoming
    data until :meth:`recv` is called. In this situation, various receive
    buffers (at least in :mod:`asyncio` and in the OS) will fill up, then the
    TCP receive window will shrink, slowing down transmission to avoid packet
    loss.

    Since Python can use up to 4 bytes of memory to represent a single
    character, each connection may use up to ``4 * max_size * max_queue``
    bytes of memory to store incoming messages. By default, this is 128 MiB.
    You may want to lower the limits, depending on your application's
    requirements.

    The ``read_limit`` argument sets the high-water limit of the buffer for
    incoming bytes. The low-water limit is half the high-water limit. The
    default value is 64 KiB, half of asyncio's default (based on the current
    implementation of :class:`~asyncio.StreamReader`).

    The ``write_limit`` argument sets the high-water limit of the buffer for
    outgoing bytes. The low-water limit is a quarter of the high-water limit.
    The default value is 64 KiB, equal to asyncio's default (based on the
    current implementation of ``FlowControlMixin``).

    See the discussion of :doc:`memory usage <../../topics/memory>` for details.

    Args:
        logger: Logger for this server.
            It defaults to ``logging.getLogger("websockets.protocol")``.
            See the :doc:`logging guide <../../topics/logging>` for details.
        ping_interval: Interval between keepalive pings in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables keepalive.
        ping_timeout: Timeout for keepalive pings in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables timeouts.
        close_timeout: Timeout for closing the connection in seconds.
            For legacy reasons, the actual timeout is 4 or 5 times larger.
        max_size: Maximum size of incoming messages in bytes.
            :obj:`None` disables the limit.
        max_queue: Maximum number of incoming messages in receive buffer.
            :obj:`None` disables the limit.
        read_limit: High-water mark of read buffer in bytes.
        write_limit: High-water mark of write buffer in bytes.

        Send a message.

        A string (:class:`str`) is sent as a Text_ frame. A bytestring or
        bytes-like object (:class:`bytes`, :class:`bytearray`, or
        :class:`memoryview`) is sent as a Binary_ frame.

        .. _Text: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.6
        .. _Binary: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.6

        :meth:`send` also accepts an iterable or an asynchronous iterable of
        strings, bytestrings, or bytes-like objects to enable fragmentation_.
        Each item is treated as a message fragment and sent in its own frame.
        All items must be of the same type, or else :meth:`send` will raise a
        :exc:`TypeError` and the connection will be closed.

        .. _fragmentation: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.4

        :meth:`send` rejects dict-like objects because this is often an error.
        (If you want to send the keys of a dict-like object as fragments, call
        its :meth:`~dict.keys` method and pass the result to :meth:`send`.)

        Canceling :meth:`send` is discouraged. Instead, you should close the
        connection with :meth:`close`. Indeed, there are only two situations
        where :meth:`send` may yield control to the event loop and then get
        canceled; in both cases, :meth:`close` has the same effect and is
        more clear:

        1. The write buffer is full. If you don't want to wait until enough
           data is sent, your only alternative is to close the connection.
           :meth:`close` will likely time out then abort the TCP connection.
        2. ``message`` is an asynchronous iterator that yields control.
           Stopping in the middle of a fragmented message will cause a
           protocol error and the connection will be closed.

        When the connection is closed, :meth:`send` raises
        :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed`. Specifically, it
        raises :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedOK` after a normal
        connection closure and
        :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError` after a protocol
        error or a network failure.

    """
    Broadcast a message to several WebSocket connections.

    A string (:class:`str`) is sent as a Text_ frame. A bytestring or bytes-like
    object (:class:`bytes`, :class:`bytearray`, or :class:`memoryview`) is sent
    as a Binary_ frame.

    .. _Text: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.6

    :func:`broadcast` pushes the message synchronously to all connections even
    if their write buffers are overflowing. There's no backpressure.

    If you broadcast messages faster than a connection can handle them, messages
    will pile up in its write buffer until the connection times out. Keep
    ``ping_interval`` and ``ping_timeout`` low to prevent excessive memory usage
    from slow connections.

    Unlike :meth:`~websockets.legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.send`,
    :func:`broadcast` doesn't support sending fragmented messages. Indeed,
    fragmentation is useful for sending large messages without buffering them in
    memory, while :func:`broadcast` buffers one copy per connection as fast as
    possible.

    :func:`broadcast` skips connections that aren't open in order to avoid
    errors on connections where the closing handshake is in progress.

    :func:`broadcast` ignores failures to write the message on some connections.
    It continues writing to other connections. On Python 3.11 and above, you may
    set ``raise_exceptions`` to :obj:`True` to record failures and raise all
    exceptions in a :pep:`654` :exc:`ExceptionGroup`.

    While :func:`broadcast` makes more sense for servers, it works identically
    with clients, if you have a use case for opening connections to many servers
    and broadcasting a message to them.

    Args:
        websockets: WebSocket connections to which the message will be sent.
