# A WebSocket connection goes through the following four states, in order:

# In order to ensure consistency, the code always checks the current value of

class WebSocketCommonProtocol(asyncio.StreamReaderProtocol):
    """
    This class implements common parts of the WebSocket protocol.

    It assumes that the WebSocket connection is established. The handshake is
    managed in subclasses such as
    :class:`~websockets.server.WebSocketServerProtocol` and
    :class:`~websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol`.

    It runs a task that stores incoming data frames in a queue and deals with
    control frames automatically. It sends outgoing data frames and performs
    the closing handshake.

    On Python â‰¥ 3.6, :class:`WebSocketCommonProtocol` instances support
    asynchronous iteration::

        async for message in websocket:
            await process(message)

    The iterator yields incoming messages. It exits normally when the
    connection is closed with the status code 1000 OK. It raises a
    :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed` exception when the
    connection is closed with any other status code.

    The ``host``, ``port`` and ``secure`` parameters are simply stored as
    attributes for handlers that need them.

    The ``timeout`` parameter defines the maximum wait time in seconds for
    completing the closing handshake and, only on the client side, for
    terminating the TCP connection. :meth:`close()` will complete in at most
    ``4 * timeout`` on the server side and ``5 * timeout`` on the client side.

    The ``max_size`` parameter enforces the maximum size for incoming messages
    in bytes. The default value is 1MB. ``None`` disables the limit. If a
    message larger than the maximum size is received, :meth:`recv()` will
    raise :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed` and the connection
    will be closed with status code 1009.

    The ``max_queue`` parameter sets the maximum length of the queue that holds
    incoming messages. The default value is 32. 0 disables the limit. Messages
    are added to an in-memory queue when they're received; then :meth:`recv()`
    pops from that queue. In order to prevent excessive memory consumption when
    messages are received faster than they can be processed, the queue must be
    bounded. If the queue fills up, the protocol stops processing incoming data
    until :meth:`recv()` is called. In this situation, various receive buffers
    (at least in ``asyncio`` and in the OS) will fill up, then the TCP receive
    window will shrink, slowing down transmission to avoid packet loss.

    Since Python can use up to 4 bytes of memory to represent a single
    character, each websocket connection may use up to ``4 * max_size *
    max_queue`` bytes of memory to store incoming messages. By default,
    this is 128MB. You may want to lower the limits, depending on your
    application's requirements.

    The ``read_limit`` argument sets the high-water limit of the buffer for
    incoming bytes. The low-water limit is half the high-water limit. The
    default value is 64kB, half of asyncio's default (based on the current
    implementation of :class:`~asyncio.StreamReader`).

    The ``write_limit`` argument sets the high-water limit of the buffer for
    outgoing bytes. The low-water limit is a quarter of the high-water limit.
    The default value is 64kB, equal to asyncio's default (based on the
    current implementation of ``FlowControlMixin``).

    As soon as the HTTP request and response in the opening handshake are
    processed, the request path is available in the :attr:`path` attribute,
    and the request and response HTTP headers are available:

    * as a :class:`~http.client.HTTPMessage` in the :attr:`request_headers`
      and :attr:`response_headers` attributes
    * as an iterable of (name, value) pairs in the :attr:`raw_request_headers`
      and :attr:`raw_response_headers` attributes

    These attributes must be treated as immutable.

    If a subprotocol was negotiated, it's available in the :attr:`subprotocol`
    attribute.

    Once the connection is closed, the status code is available in the
    :attr:`close_code` attribute and the reason in :attr:`close_reason`.
