    :mod:`trio` implementation of a WebSocket server connection.

    :class:`ServerConnection` provides :meth:`recv` and :meth:`send` methods for
    receiving and sending messages.

    It supports asynchronous iteration to receive messages::

        async for message in websocket:
            await process(message)

    The iterator exits normally when the connection is closed with close code
    1000 (OK) or 1001 (going away) or without a close code. It raises a
    :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError` when the connection is
    closed with any other code.

    The ``ping_interval``, ``ping_timeout``, ``close_timeout``, and
    ``max_queue`` arguments have the same meaning as in :func:`serve`.

    Args:
        nursery: Trio nursery.
        stream: Trio stream connected to a WebSocket client.

    Args:
        handler: Connection handler. It receives the WebSocket connection,
            which is a :class:`ServerConnection`, in argument.
        port: TCP port the server listens on.
            See :func:`~trio.open_tcp_listeners` for details.
        host: Network interfaces the server binds to.
            See :func:`~trio.open_tcp_listeners` for details.
        backlog: Listen backlog. See :func:`~trio.open_tcp_listeners` for
            details.
        listeners: Preexisting TCP listeners. ``listeners`` replaces ``port``,
            ``host``, and ``backlog``. See :func:`trio.serve_listeners` for
            details.
        ssl: Configuration for enabling TLS on the connection.
        origins: Acceptable values of the ``Origin`` header, for defending
            against Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking attacks. Values can be
            :class:`str` to test for an exact match or regular expressions
            compiled by :func:`re.compile` to test against a pattern. Include
            :obj:`None` in the list if the lack of an origin is acceptable.
        extensions: List of supported extensions, in order in which they
            should be negotiated and run.
        subprotocols: List of supported subprotocols, in order of decreasing
            preference.
        select_subprotocol: Callback for selecting a subprotocol among
            those supported by the client and the server. It receives a
            :class:`ServerConnection` (not a
            :class:`~websockets.server.ServerProtocol`!) instance and a list of
            subprotocols offered by the client. Other than the first argument,
            it has the same behavior as the
            :meth:`ServerProtocol.select_subprotocol
            <websockets.server.ServerProtocol.select_subprotocol>` method.
        compression: The "permessage-deflate" extension is enabled by default.
            Set ``compression`` to :obj:`None` to disable it. See the
            :doc:`compression guide <../../topics/compression>` for details.
        process_request: Intercept the request during the opening handshake.
            Return an HTTP response to force the response. Return :obj:`None` to
            continue normally. When you force an HTTP 101 Continue response, the
            handshake is successful. Else, the connection is aborted.
        process_response: Intercept the response during the opening handshake.
            Modify the response or return a new HTTP response to force the
            response. Return :obj:`None` to continue normally. When you force an
            HTTP 101 Continue response, the handshake is successful. Else, the
            connection is aborted.
        server_header: Value of  the ``Server`` response header.
            It defaults to ``"Python/x.y.z websockets/X.Y"``. Setting it to
            :obj:`None` removes the header.
        open_timeout: Timeout for opening connections in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables the timeout.
        ping_interval: Interval between keepalive pings in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables keepalive.
        ping_timeout: Timeout for keepalive pings in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables timeouts.
        close_timeout: Timeout for closing connections in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables the timeout.
        max_size: Maximum size of incoming messages in bytes.
            :obj:`None` disables the limit. You may pass a ``(max_message_size,
            max_fragment_size)`` tuple to set different limits for messages and
            fragments when you expect long messages sent in short fragments.
        max_queue: High-water mark of the buffer where frames are received.
            It defaults to 16 frames. The low-water mark defaults to ``max_queue
            // 4``. You may pass a ``(high, low)`` tuple to set the high-water
            and low-water marks. If you want to disable flow control entirely,
            you may set it to ``None``, although that's a bad idea.
        logger: Logger for this server.
