    Args:
        handler: Connection handler. It receives the WebSocket connection,
            which is a :class:`ServerConnection`, in argument.
        host: Network interfaces the server binds to.
            See :meth:`~asyncio.loop.create_server` for details.
        port: TCP port the server listens on.
            See :meth:`~asyncio.loop.create_server` for details.
        origins: Acceptable values of the ``Origin`` header, for defending
            against Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking attacks. Include :obj:`None`
            in the list if the lack of an origin is acceptable.
        extensions: List of supported extensions, in order in which they
            should be negotiated and run.
        subprotocols: List of supported subprotocols, in order of decreasing
            preference.
        select_subprotocol: Callback for selecting a subprotocol among
            those supported by the client and the server. It receives a
            :class:`ServerConnection` (not a
            :class:`~websockets.server.ServerProtocol`!) instance and a list of
            subprotocols offered by the client. Other than the first argument,
            it has the same behavior as the
            :meth:`ServerProtocol.select_subprotocol
            <websockets.server.ServerProtocol.select_subprotocol>` method.
        process_request: Intercept the request during the opening handshake.
            Return an HTTP response to force the response or :obj:`None` to
            continue normally. When you force an HTTP 101 Continue response, the
            handshake is successful. Else, the connection is aborted.
            ``process_request`` may be a function or a coroutine.
        process_response: Intercept the response during the opening handshake.
            Return an HTTP response to force the response or :obj:`None` to
            continue normally. When you force an HTTP 101 Continue response, the
            handshake is successful. Else, the connection is aborted.
            ``process_response`` may be a function or a coroutine.
        server_header: Value of  the ``Server`` response header.
            It defaults to ``"Python/x.y.z websockets/X.Y"``. Setting it to
            :obj:`None` removes the header.
        compression: The "permessage-deflate" extension is enabled by default.
            Set ``compression`` to :obj:`None` to disable it. See the
            :doc:`compression guide <../../topics/compression>` for details.
        open_timeout: Timeout for opening connections in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables the timeout.
        close_timeout: Timeout for closing connections in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables the timeout.
        max_size: Maximum size of incoming messages in bytes.
            :obj:`None` disables the limit.
        logger: Logger for this server.
            It defaults to ``logging.getLogger("websockets.server")``. See the
            :doc:`logging guide <../../topics/logging>` for details.
        create_connection: Factory for the :class:`ServerConnection` managing
            the connection. Set it to a wrapper or a subclass to customize
            connection handling.

    Any other keyword arguments are passed to the event loop's
    :meth:`~asyncio.loop.create_server` method.

    For example:

    * You can set ``ssl`` to a :class:`~ssl.SSLContext` to enable TLS.

    * You can set ``sock`` to provide a preexisting TCP socket. You may call
      :func:`socket.create_server` (not to be confused with the event loop's
      :meth:`~asyncio.loop.create_server` method) to create a suitable server
      socket and customize it.

    * You can set ``start_serving`` to ``False`` to start accepting connections
      only after you call :meth:`~WebSocketServer.start_serving()` or
      :meth:`~WebSocketServer.serve_forever()`.
