Compression
===========

.. currentmodule:: websockets.extensions.permessage_deflate

Most WebSocket servers exchange JSON messages because they're convenient to
parse and serialize in a browser. These messages contain text data and tend to
be repetitive.

This makes the stream of messages highly compressible. Enabling compression
can reduce network traffic by more than 80%.

There's a standard for compressing messages. :rfc:`7692` defines WebSocket
Per-Message Deflate, a compression extension based on the Deflate_ algorithm.

.. _Deflate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate

Configuring compression
-----------------------

:func:`~websockets.client.connect` and :func:`~websockets.server.serve` enable
compression by default because the reduction in network bandwidth is usually
worth the additional memory and CPU cost.

If you want to disable compression, set ``compression=None``::

    import websockets

    websockets.connect(..., compression=None)

    websockets.serve(..., compression=None)

If you want to customize compression settings, you can enable the Per-Message
Deflate extension explicitly with :class:`ClientPerMessageDeflateFactory` or
:class:`ServerPerMessageDeflateFactory`::

    import websockets
    from websockets.extensions import permessage_deflate

    websockets.connect(
        ...,
        extensions=[
            permessage_deflate.ClientPerMessageDeflateFactory(
                server_max_window_bits=11,
                client_max_window_bits=11,
                compress_settings={"memLevel": 4},
            ),
        ],
    )

    websockets.serve(
        ...,
        extensions=[
            permessage_deflate.ServerPerMessageDeflateFactory(
                server_max_window_bits=11,
                client_max_window_bits=11,
                compress_settings={"memLevel": 4},
            ),
        ],
    )

The Window Bits and Memory Level values in these examples reduce memory usage at the expense of compression rate.

Compression settings
--------------------

When a client and a server enable the Per-Message Deflate extension, they
negotiate two parameters to guarantee compatibility between compression and
decompression. This affects the trade-off between compression rate and memory
usage for both sides.

* **Context Takeover** means that the compression context is retained between
  messages. In other words, compression is applied to the stream of messages
  rather than to each message individually. Context takeover should remain
  enabled to get good performance on applications that send a stream of
  messages with the same structure, that is, most applications.

* **Window Bits** controls the size of the compression context. It must be
  an integer between 9 (lowest memory usage) and 15 (best compression).
  websockets defaults to 12. Setting it to 8 is possible but rejected by some
  versions of zlib.

:mod:`zlib` offers additional parameters for tuning compression. They control
the trade-off between compression rate and CPU and memory usage for the
compression side, transparently for the decompression side.

* **Memory Level** controls the size of the compression state. It must be an
  integer between 1 (lowest memory usage) and 9 (best compression). websockets
  defaults to 5. A lower memory level can increase speed thanks to memory
  locality.

* **Compression Level** controls the effort to optimize compression. It must
  be an integer between 1 (lowest CPU usage) and 9 (best compression).

* **Strategy** selects the compression strategy. The best choice depends on
  the type of data being compressed.

Unless mentioned otherwise, websockets uses the defaults of
:func:`zlib.compressobj` for all these settings.

Tuning compression
------------------

By default, websockets enables compression with conservative settings that
optimize memory usage at the cost of a slightly worse compression rate: Window
Bits = 12 and Memory Level = 5. This strikes a good balance for small messages
that are typical of WebSocket servers.

Here's how various compression settings affect memory usage of a single
connection on a 64-bit system, as well a benchmark of compressed size and
compression time for a corpus of small JSON documents.

Window Bits and Memory Level don't have to move in lockstep. However, other
combinations don't yield significantly better results than those shown above.

Compressed size and compression time depend heavily on the kind of messages
exchanged by the application so this example may not apply to your use case.

You can adapt `compression/benchmark.py`_ by creating a list of typical
messages and passing it to the ``_run`` function.

Window Bits = 11 and Memory Level = 4 looks like the sweet spot in this table.

websockets defaults to Window Bits = 12 and Memory Level = 5 to stay away from
Window Bits = 10 or Memory Level = 3 where performance craters, raising doubts
on what could happen at Window Bits = 11 and Memory Level = 4 on a different
corpus.

Defaults must be safe for all applications, hence a more conservative choice.

.. _compression/benchmark.py: https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets/blob/main/experiments/compression/benchmark.py

The benchmark focuses on compression because it's more expensive than
decompression. Indeed, leaving aside small allocations, theoretical memory
usage is:

* ``(1 << (windowBits + 2)) + (1 << (memLevel + 9))`` for compression;
* ``1 << windowBits`` for decompression.

CPU usage is also higher for compression than decompression.
