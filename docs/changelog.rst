*In development*

.. warning::

    **Version 4.0 introduces a backwards-incompatible change in the**
    :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketClientProtocol.handshake` and
    :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketServerProtocol.handshake` **APIs.**

    **If you're upgrading from 3.x or earlier, please read this carefully.**

    Both used to read and write handshake requests and responses. Now they're
    regular methods, not coroutines. I/O is performed by their caller. Their
    arguments and return values changed accordingly.

    If you're overriding these methods, you must review and update your code.

Also:

* Renamed :func:`~websockets.server.serve()` and
  :func:`~websockets.client.connect()`'s ``klass`` argument to
  ``create_protocol`` to reflect that it can also be a callable.
  For backwards compatibility, ``klass`` is still supported.

* :func:`~websockets.server.serve` can be used as an asynchronous context
  manager on Python ≥ 3.5.

* Added support for customizing handling of incoming connections with
  :meth:`~websockets.server.WebSocketServerProtocol.process_request()`.

* Made read and write buffer sizes configurable.

* Rewrote HTTP handling for simplicity and performance.

* Added an optional C extension to speed up low level operations.

* An invalid response status code during :func:`~websockets.client.connect`
  now raises :class:`~websockets.exceptions.InvalidStatus` with a ``code``
  attribute.

3.3
...

* Reduced noise in logs caused by connection resets.

* Avoided crashing on concurrent writes on slow connections.

3.2
...

* Added ``timeout``, ``max_size``, and ``max_queue`` arguments to
  :func:`~websockets.client.connect()` and :func:`~websockets.server.serve()`.

* Made server shutdown more robust.

3.1
...

* Avoided a warning when closing a connection before the opening handshake.

* Added flow control for incoming data.

.. warning::

    **Version 3.0 introduces a backwards-incompatible change in the**
    :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.recv` **API.**

    **If you're upgrading from 2.x or earlier, please read this carefully.**

    :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.recv` used to return
    ``None`` when the connection was closed. This required checking the return
    value of every call::

        message = await websocket.recv()
        if message is None:
            return

    Now it raises a :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed` exception
    instead. This is more Pythonic. The previous code can be simplified to::

        message = await websocket.recv()

    When implementing a server, which is the more popular use case, there's no
    strong reason to handle such exceptions. Let them bubble up, terminate the
    handler coroutine, and the server will simply ignore them.

    In order to avoid stranding projects built upon an earlier version, the
    previous behavior can be restored by passing ``legacy_recv=True`` to
    :func:`~websockets.server.serve`, :func:`~websockets.client.connect`,
    :class:`~websockets.server.WebSocketServerProtocol`, or
    :class:`~websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol`. ``legacy_recv`` isn't
    documented in their signatures but isn't scheduled for deprecation either.

Also:

* :func:`~websockets.client.connect` can be used as an asynchronous context
  manager on Python ≥ 3.5.

* Updated documentation with ``await`` and ``async`` syntax from Python 3.5.

* :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.ping` and
  :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.pong` supports
  data passed as :class:`str` in addition to :class:`bytes`.

* Worked around an asyncio bug affecting connection termination under load.

* Made ``state_name`` atttribute on protocols a public API.

* Improved documentation.

2.7
...

* Added compatibility with Python 3.5.

* Refreshed documentation.

2.6
...

* Added ``local_address`` and ``remote_address`` attributes on protocols.

* Closed open connections with code 1001 when a server shuts down.

* Avoided TCP fragmentation of small frames.

2.5
...

* Improved documentation.

* Provided access to handshake request and response HTTP headers.

* Allowed customizing handshake request and response HTTP headers.

* Supported running on a non-default event loop.

* Returned a 403 error code instead of 400 when the request Origin isn't
  allowed.

* Cancelling :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.recv` no
  longer drops the next message.

* Clarified that the closing handshake can be initiated by the client.

* Set the close status code and reason more consistently.

* Strengthened connection termination by simplifying the implementation.

* Improved tests, added tox configuration, and enforced 100% branch coverage.

2.4
...

* Added support for subprotocols.

* Supported non-default event loop.

* Added ``loop`` argument to :func:`~websockets.client.connect` and
  :func:`~websockets.server.serve`.

2.3
...

* Improved compliance of close codes.

2.2
...

* Added support for limiting message size.

2.1
...

* Added ``host``, ``port`` and ``secure`` attributes on protocols.

* Added support for providing and checking Origin_.

.. warning::

    **Version 2.0 introduces a backwards-incompatible change in the**
    :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.send`,
    :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.ping`, and
    :meth:`~websockets.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.pong` **APIs.**

    **If you're upgrading from 1.x or earlier, please read this carefully.**

    These APIs used to be functions. Now they're coroutines.

    Instead of::

        websocket.send(message)

    you must now write::

        await websocket.send(message)

Also:

* Added flow control for outgoing data.

1.0
...

* Initial public release.
